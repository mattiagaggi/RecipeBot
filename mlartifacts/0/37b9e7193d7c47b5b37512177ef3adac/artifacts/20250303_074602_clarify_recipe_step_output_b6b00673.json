  "output": "In Step 2 of the recipe, it states: \"Add the melted butter and salt to the yeast mixture.\" Here\u2019s a clear guidance for this step, including a bit more detail to ensure understanding:\n\n### Clarified Guidance for Step 2:\n\n1. **Melt the Butter**: Before adding it to the yeast mixture, make sure the butter is fully melted. You can do this by cutting the butter into small pieces and placing it in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in short intervals (about 15-20 seconds), stirring in between, until the butter is completely melted. Alternatively, you can melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat on the stove.\n\n2. **Check Temperature**: Ensure that the melted butter is not too hot, as adding very hot butter directly to the yeast mixture might kill the yeast. It should be warm to the touch, but not boiling.\n\n3. **Combine Ingredients**: Once the butter is melted and at the right temperature, pour it into the bowl with the yeast mixture. Then, sprinkle the salt over the top. \n\n4. **Mix Thoroughly**: Use a whisk or a wooden spoon to stir the mixture until the melted butter and salt are well incorporated into the yeast mixture.\n\nBy following these detailed steps, you'll ensure that the ingredientes blend well and the yeast remains active for the rising process."
