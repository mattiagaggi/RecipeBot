  "output": "In the recipe, step 2 states: \"Slowly add the warm water to the dry ingredients. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.\" Here\u2019s a clarification for this step to ensure better understanding:\n\n### Clarified Step 2 Guidance:\n\n1. **Warm Water**: First, make sure your warm water is at a temperature of about 110\u00b0F to 115\u00b0F (43\u00b0C to 46\u00b0C). It should feel warm to the touch but not hot, to ensure the yeast activates properly without killing it.\n\n2. **Pouring the Water**: Pour the warm water slowly into the large mixing bowl containing the dry ingredients (flour, yeast, salt, and sugar). It\u2019s best to do this gradually rather than all at once to allow the dry ingredients to absorb the water properly.\n\n3. **Mixing**: Using a wooden spoon, spatula, or your hands, start stirring the mixture gently as you pour in the warm water. Continue to mix until the flour is hydrated and you can see that the dough is starting to come together. \n\n4. **Shaggy Dough**: A \"shaggy dough\" means that the dough should still look rough and somewhat sticky, with bits of flour still visible. It shouldn\u2019t be completely smooth or kneaded at this stage.\n\n5. **Consistency Check**: If the mixture seems extremely dry and there are still a lot of loose flour particles, you can add a little more warm water, a tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the shaggy consistency. \n\nThis step is crucial for ensuring that your bread will have the right texture, so take your time during the mixing process! \n\nBy following these clarifications, you should be able to complete this step effectively while keeping in line with the original recipe."
