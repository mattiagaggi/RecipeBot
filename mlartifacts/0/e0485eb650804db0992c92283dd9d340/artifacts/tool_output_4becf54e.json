Start from the edges and work your way toward the center, ensuring that all the dry ingredients are incorporated. The dough may still look quite shaggy at this point.\n3. **Incorporate Fully:** Continue mixing until the dry ingredients are mostly combined and a dough begins to come together. You may find that you need to use your hands at this stage to form the dough, especially if the mixture is still crumbly.\n4. **Forming the Dough:** Once most of the flour has been incorporated, use your hands to gather it into a ball. It should hold together, but you should see minimal stickiness. If it\u2019s too sticky, you can sprinkle in a little more flour as needed.\n\n**Note:** Make sure not to overmix as this can lead to a dense bread. The goal is to combine the ingredients just enough to form a cohesive dough. \n\nThis clarification ensures that you understand how to effectively combine the wet and dry ingredients to form a proper dough without changing the original instructions of the recipe."
